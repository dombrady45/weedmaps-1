The year 1964 is also emblematic of a time when people (slowly) started relaxing about the way we like to relax. It was a catalyst that propelled the modern world -- a socio-cultural revolution that changed how we think, work, discover, invent, play and create. It marked a time of change and new horizons. Public opinion began to shift from reefer madness to mad about reefer. Throughout the 60s, this movement began to revolutionize the modern world.</p> <p>Today, it is the legalization and democratization of cannabis that is re-opening the dialogue for change in our society. This type of paradigm shift is at the core of our brand ethos, as we strive to be a driving force in the conversations to come. We want our brand name, 1964 Supply Co., to be synonymous with these changes by joining the craft cannabis movement. It’s time to shatter stereotypes, shift paradigms and elevate the image of American Craft Cannabis - If there was ever a time to disrupt the cannabis industry and forge a new path, now is that time.</p>",Vape Pens,,,Blue Dream Oil Tank Cartridge,https://images.weedmaps.com/products/000/045/591/avatar/large/Suppliedby1964_BlueDreamOilTank-1.jpg,,,"<p>The calm and rooted presence of the chameleon tree grounds you in yourself like Blue Dream.

Whether for rest, love, energy, or sleep, flavor and sophistication are apparent in every bite. 1906 understands that our moments are precious, which is why their chocolates are formulated for rapid delivery. The onset of effects occurs quickly, well-balanced by complementary botanicals that offset any feelings of nervousness or angst. Enjoy pure, euphoric bliss and return to your senses, 1906 will take you there.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>History</strong></p> <p>1906 developed with the vision of redefining the meaning of premium, cannabis-infused edibles. The founder took a journey back before United States prohibition and reimagined a time where freedom, high style, sensuality, and good taste were common. He got to work developing a line of cannabis-infused chocolates that combine the powerful qualities of cacao, cannabis, and ethnobotanical ingredients. In January of 2015, 1906 officially launched their brand, debuting their cannabis chocolates to the Colorado market. On Valentine’s Day of 2015, 1906 introduced a new cannabis chocolate, High Love, the most sensual thing you will ever put in your mouth. As 1906 continues, their founder and team are thrilled to continue formulating new and innovative cannabis chocolates.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Process</strong></p> <p>1906 has partnered with a cannabis cultivator that provides them with premium marijuana oil sourced from a marijuana garden headed by Master Growers that employ sustainable practices and run ecologically friendly cultivations. There are no pesticides used on their flowers, so the resulting  cannabis oil is pure and potent. 1906 chocolates are made using advanced pharmacological techniques to deliver rapid onset with mild dosage, which allows for control over the experience according to your level of comfort with THC potency. Through and through, 1906 is formulated with premium ingredients and designed to provide an incredible experience for each of your senses.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Products</strong></p> <p>1906 original line up of cannabis-infused chocolates include Midnight, Pause, and Go. Midnight will redefine your sleep experience. Midnight by 1906, contains activated cannabis as well as Corydalis, a plant said to induce sleep without adverse side effects. A dose of Midnight empowers users to find restful sleep and awake refreshed, free from any morning grogginess.</p> <p> </p> <p>1906’s Pause combines the calming powers of L-Theanine, Magnolia, and cannabis to create chocolate that melts the stress away. L-Theanine stimulates the brain’s alpha waves provoking a calm and serene experience, while Magnolia reduces tension, and improves the adaptation to stress through the endocrine system. Magnolia also activates particular cannabinoid receptors, creating a synergistic combination with marijuana. Pause will put anxiety at a stand still.</p> <p> </p> <p>All-natural and performance enhancing, Go is a caffeine and cannabis feat of accomplishment. By balancing single-strain Sativa and Caffeine with the calming effects of L-Theanine, Go supplies clean energy without the jitters. The amazing formulation of Go is available in convenient and discreet espresso beans, made with hand-picked, fresh roasted coffee beans.</p> <p> </p> <p>Last and certainly not least is 1906’s High Love, the only chocolate cannabis aphrodisiac of its kind. Through a lustful combination of the strain Blue Dream and various aphrodisiacs from around the globe, High Love delivers a plethora of targeted effects. Short-term effects increase blood flow to the pelvic area, but High Love also contains properties that reduce the production of cortisol - responsible for causing stress - which, in turn, balances sexual hormones.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Lab Testing</strong></p> <p>1906 New Highs offers cannabis-infused edibles that are lab tested, ensuring their premium chocolates are safe and free of impurities.

The founder took a journey back before United States prohibition and reimagined a time where freedom, high style, sensuality, and good taste were common. He got to work developing a line of cannabis-infused chocolates that combine the powerful qualities of cacao, cannabis, and ethnobotanical ingredients. In January of 2015, 1906 officially launched their brand, debuting their cannabis chocolates to the Colorado market. On Valentine’s Day of 2015, 1906 introduced a new cannabis chocolate, High Love, the most sensual thing you will ever put in your mouth.

L-Theanine stimulates the brain’s alpha waves provoking a calm and serene experience, while Magnolia reduces tension, and improves the adaptation to stress through the endocrine system. Magnolia also activates particular cannabinoid receptors, creating a synergistic combination with marijuana. Pause will put anxiety at a stand still.</p> <p> </p> <p>All-natural and performance enhancing, Go is a caffeine and cannabis feat of accomplishment. By balancing single-strain Sativa and Caffeine with the calming effects of L-Theanine, Go supplies clean energy without the jitters.

Through a lustful combination of the strain Blue Dream and various aphrodisiacs from around the globe, High Love delivers a plethora of targeted effects.

Bayflower,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/798/avatar/large/bayflower_logo.jpg,"<p>Bayflower™ is a brand of high-quality cannabis products packaged and distributed with the consumer in mind. No more do we as consumers have to accept the producer-driven market of yesterday, we call the shots. With BayflowerTM, you can count on the fact that each product has been through our rigorous quality control standards and packaged with love just for you!</p> <p>Every human being is as unique as the fingerprint that identifies us. When we look around, we see people of all shapes, sizes, colors and ages. Our tastes vary as widely as our wants, needs and desires. At Bayflower, we recognize that and package our products with YOU in mind.</p> <p>-Quality: First things first, we would never turn out a product that we, ourselves don’t love. It all starts with care and love from cultivation, through packaging... and if that isn’t enough, we put all of our products through lab testing not only for potency, but for biological and chemical safety and terpene profiling as well. With Bayflower, you will always know exactly what you are getting.</p> <p>-Terpenes: If you’ve heard of terpenes, you probably know that these organic compounds are responsible for the taste and smell of the cannabis plant, but there is way more to it than that. Did you know that many plants other than cannabis produce terpenes too? Just think of the last time you drove past a pine forest and smelled that lovely pine smell in the air. How about the last time you sliced through an orange and your mouth watered. The very same terpenes that created some of the simplest pleasures in nature can be found in your cannabis plant. It doesn’t stop there... terpenes can also be associated with many different healing properties.</p> <p>-Vibes: Cannabis comes in many different varieties and strains. With the exception of the high-CBD strains that are grown to limit or reduce the psychoactive nature of the THC, most strains will have some feelings associated with them. At Bayflower, we try out and test all of our products and report the feelings, or vibes associated with the products. Individual vibes will vary, but we will list the most common expectations for each strain. Check out the chart below for more info on the different types of cannabis (indica, sativa, or hybrid), common vibes associated with those types, and popular strains of each.</p> <p>There are many different types of cannabis extractions. We all remember Hash, but with new technologies and methods, there are multiple ways to extract the essential oils from the cannabis plant. Check out the chart below to learn more about the different processes and products. -What’s In The Package-</p> <p>-High Quality Shatter: We at Bayflower are constantly learning and growing and working hard to perfect as many extraction processes as possible. Currently, we are producing some of the finest shatters to hit the market. Our shatters are clean of residual solvents, passing lab tests with flying colors. They are highly stable meaning they melt on your nail, not on your hand. Above all, they are highly potent, testing in the 80%-90% THC range consistently.</p> <p>-What’s On The Label: With the care put into our flowers, why should you expect any less from our concentrates? On our labels you will find: stain name, weight, strain class (indica, sativa, and hybrid), the common vibes people experience, flavor notes and the terpenes. In addition, you can find the packaged date, and the potency of the main cannabinoids.</p>",Indica,,,Do-Si-Dos,https://images.weedmaps.com/products/000/048/207/avatar/large/1503370402-Dosidos.png,,,"<p>This indica born from Girl Scout Cookies and OG genetics.

No more do we as consumers have to accept the producer-driven market of yesterday, we call the shots. With BayflowerTM, you can count on the fact that each product has been through our rigorous quality control standards and packaged with love just for you!</p> <p>Every human being is as unique as the fingerprint that identifies us. When we look around, we see people of all shapes, sizes, colors and ages. Our tastes vary as widely as our wants, needs and desires. At Bayflower, we recognize that and package our products with YOU in mind.</p> <p>-Quality: First things first, we would never turn out a product that we, ourselves don’t love. It all starts with care and love from cultivation, through packaging... and if that isn’t enough, we put all of our products through lab testing not only for potency, but for biological and chemical safety and terpene profiling as well. With Bayflower, you will always know exactly what you are getting.</p> <p>-Terpenes: If you’ve heard of terpenes, you probably know that these organic compounds are responsible for the taste and smell of the cannabis plant, but there is way more to it than that. Did you know that many plants other than cannabis produce terpenes too? Just think of the last time you drove past a pine forest and smelled that lovely pine smell in the air. How about the last time you sliced through an orange and your mouth watered. The very same terpenes that created some of the simplest pleasures in nature can be found in your cannabis plant. It doesn’t stop there... terpenes can also be associated with many different healing properties.</p> <p>-Vibes: Cannabis comes in many different varieties and strains. With the exception of the high-CBD strains that are grown to limit or reduce the psychoactive nature of the THC, most strains will have some feelings associated with them. At Bayflower, we try out and test all of our products and report the feelings, or vibes associated with the products. Individual vibes will vary, but we will list the most common expectations for each strain. Check out the chart below for more info on the different types of cannabis (indica, sativa, or hybrid), common vibes associated with those types, and popular strains of each.</p> <p>There are many different types of cannabis extractions. We all remember Hash, but with new technologies and methods, there are multiple ways to extract the essential oils from the cannabis plant. Check out the chart below to learn more about the different processes and products. -What’s In The Package-</p> <p>-High Quality Shatter: We at Bayflower are constantly learning and growing and working hard to perfect as many extraction processes as possible. Currently, we are producing some of the finest shatters to hit the market. Our shatters are clean of residual solvents, passing lab tests with flying colors. They are highly stable meaning they melt on your nail, not on your hand. Above all, they are highly potent, testing in the 80%-90% THC range consistently.</p> <p>-What’s On The Label: With the care put into our flowers, why should you expect any less from our concentrates? On our labels you will find: stain name, weight, strain class (indica, sativa, and hybrid), the common vibes people experience, flavor notes and the terpenes. In addition, you can find the packaged date, and the potency of the main cannabinoids.</p>",Sativa,,,Candyland,https://images.weedmaps.com/products/000/048/209/avatar/large/1503370378-Candyland.png,,,"<p>Come on, get happy with this sativa strain born from Granddaddy Purple and Platinum Cookies.

It all starts with care and love from cultivation, through packaging... and if that isn’t enough, we put all of our products through lab testing not only for potency, but for biological and chemical safety and terpene profiling as well. With Bayflower, you will always know exactly what you are getting.</p> <p>-Terpenes: If you’ve heard of terpenes, you probably know that these organic compounds are responsible for the taste and smell of the cannabis plant, but there is way more to it than that. Did you know that many plants other than cannabis produce terpenes too? Just think of the last time you drove past a pine forest and smelled that lovely pine smell in the air.

At Bayflower, we try out and test all of our products and report the feelings, or vibes associated with the products.

They are highly stable meaning they melt on your nail, not on your hand. Above all, they are highly potent, testing in the 80%-90% THC range consistently.</p> <p>-What’s On The Label: With the care put into our flowers, why should you expect any less from our concentrates?

When you want sophistication while immersing yourself in the storied history of cannabis with every smoke, you turn to a Beard Bros Pharms flower strain. Reinvigorating the easy going, laid back tradition of the SoCal cannabis scene, while working to innovate and revolutionize the marijuana industry, Beard Bros Pharms ambitiously looks to make their mark in cannabis history.</p> <p><strong><ins>History:</ins></strong></p> <p>The founders of Beard Bros Pharms, Bill and Jeff, are actually bearded brothers who grew up on the East Coast, mostly in Pennsylvania and Florida. While the cannabis scene there paled in comparison to the freedoms being enjoyed on the West Coast nonetheless, the Beards developed their passion for plant cultivation and, in particular, a love for the future possibilities of the Cannabis plant. Thus, began their start in what would become an important part of their lives.</p> <p>Jointly and individually, they acquired valued experience through several business ventures, developing a broad range of skills along the way. After years of working in button up, corporate environments on the East Coast, the brothers decided to move to Colorado in 2010 to resume and broaden their interest and acumen for marijuana cultivation. They immersed themselves in the budding cannabis community and, after a year of gaining a wealth of marijuana knowledge through scientific study and practical application, the brothers migrated to Los Angeles.</p> <p>Inspired by the relaxed style and comradery of the West Coast, they began working with local growers and integrating into the SoCal cannabis community. By 2014, after years of continual learning and refining the traditions of marijuana cultivation, the brothers were ready to put their expert mark, and name, on the world of weed.</p> <p><strong><ins>The Launching of Beard Bros Pharms </ins></strong></p> <p>Since their initial brand launch, Beard Bros Pharms, has been gaining recognition at an amazing pace, making waves for their <strong>Extreme Cream</strong> strain at the 2016 Emerald Cup in San Francisco. Their expansion plans hope to provide their gourmet level marijuana strains, reinforced by their extensive plant knowledge, throughout all of California. Eventually, they plan to bring things full circle and expand Beard Bros Pharms back home to the East Coast.</p> <p><strong><ins>Process:</ins></strong></p> <p>Beard Bros Pharms has established themselves as one of the most trusted traditions of the cannabis cultivators in the Los Angeles marijuana industry. Growing all their marijuana plants indoor, utilizing hydroponic cubes, and partnering with genetic companies with larger breeding operations, Beard Bros Pharms has ability to provide the most popular strains at the highest quality of control possible. Having worked with companies such as DNA Genetics, TG Genetics, Exotic Genetix, and Ocean Grown Seeds to obtain the highest quality strains, Beard Bros Pharms is able to provide premium quality cannabis for its customers.</p> <p><strong><ins>Products:</ins></strong></p> <p>Working with marijuana strains that have become staples in the marijuana industry, Beard Bros Pharms prides itself on providing the classics for cannabis connoisseurs and newcomers alike at an affordable price.

That means responsibly testing all cannabis products. Beard Bros Pharms have worked with SC Labs and Steep Hill Labs, two of the leading cannabis analytic facilities in the marijuana industry, to test their marijuana flower strains for pesticide testing, microbial screening, and cannabinoid/potency profiles.</p> <p><strong><ins>Networks:</ins></strong></p> <p>After years of working with the San Fernando Valley cannabis community, Beard Bros Pharms has partnered with numerous marijuana brands, dispensaries, deliveries, and organizations.

Bayflower,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/798/avatar/large/bayflower_logo.jpg,"<p>Bayflower™ is a brand of high-quality cannabis products packaged and distributed with the consumer in mind. No more do we as consumers have to accept the producer-driven market of yesterday, we call the shots. With BayflowerTM, you can count on the fact that each product has been through our rigorous quality control standards and packaged with love just for you!</p> <p>Every human being is as unique as the fingerprint that identifies us. When we look around, we see people of all shapes, sizes, colors and ages. Our tastes vary as widely as our wants, needs and desires. At Bayflower, we recognize that and package our products with YOU in mind.</p> <p>-Quality: First things first, we would never turn out a product that we, ourselves don’t love. It all starts with care and love from cultivation, through packaging... and if that isn’t enough, we put all of our products through lab testing not only for potency, but for biological and chemical safety and terpene profiling as well. With Bayflower, you will always know exactly what you are getting.</p> <p>-Terpenes: If you’ve heard of terpenes, you probably know that these organic compounds are responsible for the taste and smell of the cannabis plant, but there is way more to it than that. Did you know that many plants other than cannabis produce terpenes too? Just think of the last time you drove past a pine forest and smelled that lovely pine smell in the air. How about the last time you sliced through an orange and your mouth watered. The very same terpenes that created some of the simplest pleasures in nature can be found in your cannabis plant. It doesn’t stop there... terpenes can also be associated with many different healing properties.</p> <p>-Vibes: Cannabis comes in many different varieties and strains. With the exception of the high-CBD strains that are grown to limit or reduce the psychoactive nature of the THC, most strains will have some feelings associated with them. At Bayflower, we try out and test all of our products and report the feelings, or vibes associated with the products. Individual vibes will vary, but we will list the most common expectations for each strain. Check out the chart below for more info on the different types of cannabis (indica, sativa, or hybrid), common vibes associated with those types, and popular strains of each.</p> <p>There are many different types of cannabis extractions. We all remember Hash, but with new technologies and methods, there are multiple ways to extract the essential oils from the cannabis plant. Check out the chart below to learn more about the different processes and products. -What’s In The Package-</p> <p>-High Quality Shatter: We at Bayflower are constantly learning and growing and working hard to perfect as many extraction processes as possible. Currently, we are producing some of the finest shatters to hit the market. Our shatters are clean of residual solvents, passing lab tests with flying colors. They are highly stable meaning they melt on your nail, not on your hand. Above all, they are highly potent, testing in the 80%-90% THC range consistently.</p> <p>-What’s On The Label: With the care put into our flowers, why should you expect any less from our concentrates? On our labels you will find: stain name, weight, strain class (indica, sativa, and hybrid), the common vibes people experience, flavor notes and the terpenes. In addition, you can find the packaged date, and the potency of the main cannabinoids.</p>",Concentrates,,,Sour Diesel Shatter,https://images.weedmaps.com/products/000/028/749/avatar/large/170802_Bayflower_Sativa-Wax.jpg,,,"<p>When asked how to describe the effects of this Shatter by Bayflower™, the overwhelming response was simply ""Strong!"". That response was quickly followed up by the desire to get out and get moving. Best described as ""Invigorating,"" it's ideal for the daytime, whether you're planning on getting social, active, or creative, this Sativa-dominant strain gives you the boost you need to conquer your day like the warrior you are! It is not hard to detect the notes of Gasoline, Citrus, an Hops that are present. This fast-acting strain delivers energizing, dreamy cerebral effects that have pushed Sour Diesel to its legendary status. Stress, pain, and depression fade away in long-lasting relief that makes Sour Diesel a top choice of fuel for your engine among medical patients.</p> <p>**Terpenes: Carryophyllene, Trans-Nerolidol, Humulene**</p> <p>Tested twice, by two separate labs (Harren's Labs / CW Analytics) the Bayflower brand of shatter not only passes but exceeds expectations for potency and patient safety.</p>",https://weedmaps.com/brands/bayflower/products/bayflower-sour-diesel-shatter

Specializing in old-fashioned candies, cakes, and other cannabis products, CannaBellas Candiez goes the extra mile to use all-organic ingredients, superior nutrients, and the highest quality flower in crafting their products. Traditional sweets and treats aren’t well suited for more delicate stomachs, which is why CannaBellas Candiez crafts each of their products using all-vegan materials. Women-owned and focused on the highest quality, CannaBellas Candies’ marijuana-infused edibles lend a new meaning to the word “plant-based.”</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>History:</p> <p>Patricia Flores, the visionary behind CannaBellas Candiez, started as a cannabis patient herself after dealing with stomach issues for which multiple doctors could not find a solution. Flores found smoking marijuana would make the pain go away, but noticed many products in Michigan were unhealthy or unclean - not at all up to her high standards of quality. Thus, she started making her own cannabis medicine, focused on using high-quality ingredients and healthy foods as her consumption method of choice. When Patricia shared her creations with other patients, their reaction indicated  she was onto something big.

While the cannabis scene there paled in comparison to the freedoms being enjoyed on the West Coast nonetheless, the Beards developed their passion for plant cultivation and, in particular, a love for the future possibilities of the Cannabis plant. Thus, began their start in what would become an important part of their lives.</p> <p>Jointly and individually, they acquired valued experience through several business ventures, developing a broad range of skills along the way. After years of working in button up, corporate environments on the East Coast, the brothers decided to move to Colorado in 2010 to resume and broaden their interest and acumen for marijuana cultivation. They immersed themselves in the budding cannabis community and, after a year of gaining a wealth of marijuana knowledge through scientific study and practical application, the brothers migrated to Los Angeles.</p> <p>Inspired by the relaxed style and comradery of the West Coast, they began working with local growers and integrating into the SoCal cannabis community.

Canna Butter Delight,https://images.weedmaps.com/brands/000/001/890/avatar/large/cannabutterdelights_logo200x200.jpg,"<p>Canna Butter Delight was hand-crafted to help remedy my arthritis pain and my partner's shoulder pain caused from painting and hand pain from playing guitar with his finger. I never dreamed we would be helping so many others when I made my first jar. We also love nice creams and lotions for our dry skin and I read through the ingredient list from some of our favorites and started adding and subtracting until I came up with the perfect formula. I made up sample jars and gave them out to my friends and the response was overwhelming. More and more people were asking for my cream! I ordered supplies of the ingreadients in bulk and came up with a logo, packaging design and bought jars. A local dispensary liked the idea of a ""whipped butter"" so I tried my hand at whipping the balm into a soft buttery consistency and found that it spread better on larger areas. This is the next step...to create a website and expand the size of our operation. People have told me it has helped their arthritis, pulled muscles, neuropathy pain, removed skin tags and shrunk lesions, helped their psoriasis and dermatitis, headaches and migraines, menstrual cramps and so much more! I hope you'll consider carrying my line. Recently tested by CW Analytical, the topicals tested at 58% cannibinoids, 47.5% CBD!! No wonder it works so well!</p>",Topicals,,,4 oz.

This is the next step...to create a website and expand the size of our operation. People have told me it has helped their arthritis, pulled muscles, neuropathy pain, removed skin tags and shrunk lesions, helped their psoriasis and dermatitis, headaches and migraines, menstrual cramps and so much more!

I made up sample jars and gave them out to my friends and the response was overwhelming. More and more people were asking for my cream! I ordered supplies of the ingreadients in bulk and came up with a logo, packaging design and bought jars. A local dispensary liked the idea of a ""whipped butter"" so I tried my hand at whipping the balm into a soft buttery consistency and found that it spread better on larger areas. This is the next step...to create a website and expand the size of our operation. People have told me it has helped their arthritis, pulled muscles, neuropathy pain, removed skin tags and shrunk lesions, helped their psoriasis and dermatitis, headaches and migraines, menstrual cramps and so much more!

While the cannabis scene there paled in comparison to the freedoms being enjoyed on the West Coast nonetheless, the Beards developed their passion for plant cultivation and, in particular, a love for the future possibilities of the Cannabis plant. Thus, began their start in what would become an important part of their lives.</p> <p>Jointly and individually, they acquired valued experience through several business ventures, developing a broad range of skills along the way. After years of working in button up, corporate environments on the East Coast, the brothers decided to move to Colorado in 2010 to resume and broaden their interest and acumen for marijuana cultivation. They immersed themselves in the budding cannabis community and, after a year of gaining a wealth of marijuana knowledge through scientific study and practical application, the brothers migrated to Los Angeles.</p> <p>Inspired by the relaxed style and comradery of the West Coast, they began working with local growers and integrating into the SoCal cannabis community.

Fully licensed by the Washington Liquor Control Board, the two partners bring both decades of medical growing experience and entrepreneurial expertise to the table. When Washington legalized recreational cannabis, they decided the timing was right to join the marijuana industry, supporting a cause they truly believe in while contributing clean, consistently great cannabis flower to the market. Through finding land, constructing their processing center, and other obstacles, Canna Herb Farms proudly ventures into their third season of sun-kissed cannabis cultivation, distributing their marijuana products to dispensaries throughout Washington.</p> <p>Process:</p> <p>Dedicated to the most natural cannabis products, Canna Herb Farms cultivates their plants using all-organic techniques, growing their marijuana in the sun in a remote location free of pollutants or pesticide drift. They water their plants with well-water, secluding their farmland in dense forest to protect their marijuana greens from any outside contaminants. As a Tier 2 cultivator, Canna Herb Farms pays particular attention to each of their plants, evaluating how they grow and retaining the strongest, most robust selection from each crop to continue their genetic line.</p> <p>Products:</p> <p>Canna Herb Farms has collected their variety of marijuana strains from both their personal collection and other local growers, including Monkey Grass, WOW Weed, and Contender Gardens. Their selection of flower includes their popular Acapulco Gold, Maui Wowie, Cherry Pie and Sour Grapes. Canna Herb Farms also sells pre-rolls packed with pure flower, their Sugarleaf trim dusted with plenty of trichomes, and pre-ground rolling bud ready to pack in rolling papers or a pipe.</p> <p>Lab Testing:</p> <p>Canna Herb Farms tests all of their marijuana products to ensure overall quality, consistency and purity of their goods. Sending their cannabis to True Northwest Inc. and Confidence Analytics, among others, Canna Herb Farms tests for potency, microbials, pesticides and more.</p> <p>Networks:</p> <p>Cannabis connoisseurs can find Canna Herb Farms’ marijuana goods in dispensaries throughout the Spokane, Pullman, Clarkston and Greater Seattle areas. They’re featured in Smokane, Greenfields, Satori and MJ’s Pot Shop in Pullman.</p>",Concentrates,,,Canna Kush Shatter,https://images.weedmaps.com/products/000/024/678/avatar/large/canna-herb-farms_canna-kush_3.jpg,,,"<p>Canna Herb Farms’ Canna Kush Shatter is precisely extracted from their own in-house strains, organically cultivated ensuring top-quality, maximum potency.

When you want sophistication while immersing yourself in the storied history of cannabis with every smoke, you turn to a Beard Bros Pharms flower strain. Reinvigorating the easy going, laid back tradition of the SoCal cannabis scene, while working to innovate and revolutionize the marijuana industry, Beard Bros Pharms ambitiously looks to make their mark in cannabis history.</p> <p><strong><ins>History:</ins></strong></p> <p>The founders of Beard Bros Pharms, Bill and Jeff, are actually bearded brothers who grew up on the East Coast, mostly in Pennsylvania and Florida. While the cannabis scene there paled in comparison to the freedoms being enjoyed on the West Coast nonetheless, the Beards developed their passion for plant cultivation and, in particular, a love for the future possibilities of the Cannabis plant. Thus, began their start in what would become an important part of their lives.</p> <p>Jointly and individually, they acquired valued experience through several business ventures, developing a broad range of skills along the way. After years of working in button up, corporate environments on the East Coast, the brothers decided to move to Colorado in 2010 to resume and broaden their interest and acumen for marijuana cultivation. They immersed themselves in the budding cannabis community and, after a year of gaining a wealth of marijuana knowledge through scientific study and practical application, the brothers migrated to Los Angeles.</p> <p>Inspired by the relaxed style and comradery of the West Coast, they began working with local growers and integrating into the SoCal cannabis community. By 2014, after years of continual learning and refining the traditions of marijuana cultivation, the brothers were ready to put their expert mark, and name, on the world of weed.</p> <p><strong><ins>The Launching of Beard Bros Pharms </ins></strong></p> <p>Since their initial brand launch, Beard Bros Pharms, has been gaining recognition at an amazing pace, making waves for their <strong>Extreme Cream</strong> strain at the 2016 Emerald Cup in San Francisco. Their expansion plans hope to provide their gourmet level marijuana strains, reinforced by their extensive plant knowledge, throughout all of California. Eventually, they plan to bring things full circle and expand Beard Bros Pharms back home to the East Coast.</p> <p><strong><ins>Process:</ins></strong></p> <p>Beard Bros Pharms has established themselves as one of the most trusted traditions of the cannabis cultivators in the Los Angeles marijuana industry.

Our revolutionary formulas combine CBD with nourishing essential oils and other active ingredients to aid in reducing pain, inflammation, and stress while promoting anti-aging, rejuvenation, and vibrancy. We launched in February of 2015 and are actively trying to get the word out on our revolutionary products.</p> <p>CBD is an incredible compound sourced from industrial hemp and packed with vitamins, omegas and essential fatty acids that are known to have beneficial impacts on the skin, hair, and overall body. It is being called the new ""super beauty ingredient"" and has been proven to synergize naturally with the body's endo-cannabinoid system creating ideal overall health.</p> <p>The anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties of CBD naturally aid in reducing the appearance of fine lines and help improve irritating skin conditions including acne, rosacea, eczema, and psoriasis. Clinical research published in the journal of the Federation of American Studies for Experimental Biology shows that CBD is responsible for lipid production which helps the body regulate dry skin and acne. The anti-inflammatory properties also help the body combat aches and pains when ingested and applied topically and are wonderful for naturally replenishing muscles after a hard workout.</p> <p>We created CBD for Life after our founding partner and CEO Beth learned about the wonderful healing properties of CBD. She infused CBD with essential oils to create a rub that would help manage her chronic back pain caused from scoliosis of the spine, a condition she suffered with since her early teenage years. Beth felt immediate relief from the rub she was applying daily. As a wonderful side effect of using the rub, Beth noticed a significant improvement, clearing and softening of her skin. After months of extensive research we met with a chemist to create our luxurious formulations, and two years later CBD for Life was born!</p> <p>We are very proud to be a woman owned and operated company. CBD for Life is headquartered in New Jersey where the products are produced in a large-scale contract manufacturing facility. Our products are 95% naturally derived and are free of GMO’s, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial coloring and are never tested on animals.

Alongside CBG we have also introduced CBDv which is present whilst extracting CBG<br> <br>Cannabinoids are most effective when used alongside each other. This creates what is known as the ‘entourage effect’. <strong>We at Canavape are proud to be the first in the UK to include pure CBG in our products.</strong></p> <p>Cannabis terpenes are secreted from the same glands that produce cannabinoids like THC, CBG & CBD. They are responsible for the aroma or scent of the plant. <br><br>Over 100 different terpenes have been identified with each strain having it's own unique terpene profile. Distinctive flavours like berry, citrus, mint and pine are commonly detected. <br>The most interesting characteristic of terpenes is their ability to interact synergistically with other compounds, like CBD and CBG. This wholesome synergy, commonly known as the entourage effect, offers a very unique and therapeutic experience. <br><br><strong>After months of research and development, we have formulated our terpene infused Canavape® Complete E Liquids containing pure CBG, (cannabigerol) CBD (cannabidiol) and a selection of Cannabis terpenes:</strong><br><br>Super Lemon Haze (Super Sour Haze), OG Kush (OG Jane), Mango Kush (KoKo Kush), Jack Herer, Girl Scout Cookies, Granddaddy Purple, Candy Jack, Green Crack, Blue Dream (in production), Skywalker OG & Sour Diesel!<br><br><strong>All of the above are real cannabis derived terpene profiles from the specific strains mentioned.
